Our task was to create a robot that could navigate from the start of a maze to the end without any interruption.
Our robot was built from scratch and used multiple motors and sensors. The approach we took was to construct a 
robot that followed the wall until it reached the end. Our code solution involved using each of the sensors
to change direction or speed whenever the robot bumped into a wall, turned, or got away from the wall.
Out of 12 groups, we were 1 of 3 to make it from the beginning to the end.
